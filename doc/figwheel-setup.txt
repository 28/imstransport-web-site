Configuire the site to use our custom cljs files

- For cljsbuild to see our cljs files, their location must be
defined in all :source-path where these files need to be used.
In our project "src-cljs" directory is listed in project.clj
under :cljsbuild -> :builds -> :id[main] and in dev profile
:source-paths. For dev profile dev.edn file is also updated in
:source-paths.
- The key player is main cljs namespace. That namespace is defined
in :cljsbuild -> :compiler -> :main. For dev profile it is defined
in dev.edn :figwheel -> :builds -> :id[dev] -> :main. It defines the
main namespace that will pull all other dependent namespaces. In our
project for dev profile main namespace is cljs.user, so we added a
dependecy on cljs.map in that file. cljs.map is now automaticaly
loaded and recognized by Figwheel. For non-dev profiles i.e. production
main namespace will be cljs.map as it is defined in project.clj.
