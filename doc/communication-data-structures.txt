:origin - represents the start location of transport with its latidute and longitude.
:dest - the destination location with its latidute and longitude.

{:destination-addresses [s/Str]
 :origin-addresses [s/Str]
 :total-distance s/Str
 :total-duration s/Str
 :total-distance-m s/Num
 :total-duration-s s/Num
 :price s/Num}

:destination-addresses - represents a collection of addresses of the destination.
:origin-addresses - represents a collection of addresses of the origin locations.
:total-distance - total distance in km as a formated string.
:total-duration - total travel duration in h as as formated string.
:total-distance-m - total distance in m.
